* Evil mode

This is a slightly modified version of [[https://bitbucket.org/lyro/evil/wiki/Home][evil-mode]] in an attempt to make
it behave better when using the graphical Emacs Mac port.  These
changes are incompatible with non OS X systems as well as the command
line version of Emacs.

** Differences from upstream
*** Clipboard handling
    =x-selection-value-internal= is used to get clipboard data and the
    interprogram cut and paste functions are disabled in =evil-local-mode=.

*** Copy-on-visual-motion bug fix
    =x-select-text= always copies the selection to the clipboard on
    NextStep and the Mac port.  The fix here prevents =x-select-text=
    from being called inside =evil-visual-update-x-selection=.
