* Evil mode

This is a slightly modified version of [[https://bitbucket.org/lyro/evil/wiki/Home][evil-mode]] in an attempt to make
it behave better on OS X.

** Differences from upstream
*** Clipboard handling
    =ns-{get,set}-selection-internal= are used for getting and setting
    the =*= and =+= registers in order to ensure consistent clipboard
    handling on OS X like you would get in standard VIM.  The default
    behavior of Evil here generally breaks in surprising ways due to
    =x-{get,set}-selection=.  The interprogram cut and paste functions
    are disabled in =evil-local-mode=.

*** Copy-on-visual-motion bug fix
    =x-select-text= always copies the selection to the clipboard on
    NextStep, the fix here prevents =evil-visual-update-x-selection=
    from calling =x-select-text= on those systems.
